    - I went to a concert with a friend. 
    - This concert was held in a small bar, and the place could hold about 100 
    people. These 100 people were all fans of this singer. We could see the singer's 
    performance very close. 
    - The singer performed a total of 10 songs, a few of which were very quiet and 
    others were more upbeat. 
    - We were very relaxed while watching the performance, and our mood slowly 
    calmed down with the music. 
    - The performance was very interactive and we swayed our bodies to the 
    rhythm of the music.
