## B+ Tree

### Structure

|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

- Every root to leaf path has the same number of edges (the height of the tree). In this
sense, B+ trees are always balanced. 
- Only the leaf nodes contain records (or pointers to records). The
inner nodes (which are the non-leaf nodes) do not contain the actual records.

**Leaf Node**

- For i = 1, 2, ..., n–1, pointer $P_i$ points to a file record with search-key value $K_i$

- $P_n$ points to next leaf node in search-key order

**Non-Leaf Node**

- All the search-keys in the subtree to which $P_i$ points have values greater than or equal to $K_{i-1}$ and less than $K_i$ 

- All the search-keys in the subtree to which $P_n$ points have values greater than or equal to $K_{n-1}$

### Occupancy Invariant

- Each node that is not a root or a leaf has between$\lceil n/2 \rceil$ and n children.
- A leaf node has between $\lceil (n-1)/2 \rceil$ and n–1 values
- Special cases: 
    - If the root is not a leaf, it has at least 2 children.
    - If the root is a leaf (that is, there are no other nodes in the tree), it can have between 0 and (n–1) values

### Insertion

To insert an entry into the B+ tree, follow this procedure:

1. Find the leaf node L in which you will insert your value. You can do this by traversing down
the tree. Add the key and the record to the leaf node in order.

2. If L overflows (L has more than 2d entries)...
    - (1)Split into L1 and L2. Keep d entries in L1 (this means d + 1 entries will go in L2).
    - (2)If L was a leaf node, COPY L2’s first entry into the parent. If L was not a leaf node,
MOVE L2’s first entry into the parent.
    - (3)Adjust pointers.

3. If the parent overflows, then recurse on it by doing step 2 on the parent.
