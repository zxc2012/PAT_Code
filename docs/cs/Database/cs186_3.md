## B Tree
### Concept
Problem with BST: Adding new leaves at the bottom makes it imbalanced
-> Avoid new leaves by "overstuffing" the leaf nodes

Height is balanced, but leaf nodes can get too juicy

Solution: Set a limit L on the number of items, say L=3, move the left-middle

B(balanced/bushy)-trees of order L=3 are also called a 2-3-4(number of children) tree or a 2-4 tree

### B-Tree Runtime Analysis

Height: 
- Largest possible height is all non-leaf nodes have 1 item ($log_2n$)
- Smallest possible height is all nodes have L items ($log_{l+1}n$)
- Overall height is therefore Θ(log n) 

Contains:
- Worst case number of nodes to inspect: H + 1
- Worst case number of items to inspect per node: L
- Overall runtime: O(HL) = O(log n)

Add:
- Worst case number of nodes to inspect: H + 1
- Worst case number of items to inspect per node: L
- Worst case number of split operations: H + 1
- Overall runtime: O(HL) = O(log n)




## B+ Tree

### Structure

Node[…, ($P_i,K_i$), …]

|$P_1$|$K_1$|$P_2$|...|$P_{n-1}$|$K_{n-1}$|$P_n$|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

- Every root to leaf path has the same number of edges (the height of the tree). In this
sense, B+ trees are always balanced. 
- Only the leaf nodes contain records (or pointers to records). The
inner nodes (which are the non-leaf nodes) do not contain the actual records.

**Leaf Node**

- For i = 1, 2, ..., n–1, pointer $P_i$ points to a file record with search-key value $K_i$

- $P_n$ points to next leaf node in search-key order

**Non-Leaf Node**

- All the search-keys in the subtree to which $P_i$ points have values greater than or equal to $K_{i-1}$ and less than $K_i$ 

- All the search-keys in the subtree to which $P_n$ points have values greater than or equal to $K_{n-1}$

### Occupancy Invariant

- Each node that is not a root or a leaf has between$\lceil n/2 \rceil$ and n children.
- A leaf node has between $\lceil (n-1)/2 \rceil$ and n–1 values
- Special cases: 
    - If the root is not a leaf, it has at least 2 children.
    - If the root is a leaf (that is, there are no other nodes in the tree), it can have between 0 and (n–1) values

### Insertion

To insert an entry into the B+ tree, follow this procedure:

1. Find the leaf node L, insert (pointer,key-value) pair in the leaf node

2. If L overflows
- LeafNode: 看 Key

    - (1)take the 2d+1 (pointer,search-key value) pairs (including the one being inserted,also there is a next pointer) in sorted order. Split into L1 and L2. Keep d pairs in L1 (this means d + 1 pairs will go in L2).
    - (2)If L was a leaf node, **COPY** L2’s first pair into the parent.
    If L was not a leaf node, **MOVE** L2’s first pair into the parent.

- NonLeafNode: 看pointers(Childrens)

    - (1) Split n+1 pointers into L1 and L2. 
    Keep $\lfloor{(n+1)/2}\rfloor$ in L1, rest go to L2.
    - (2) **MOVE** L2’s first pair(pointer这里只移动线,不带对象) into the parent.
    - (3) reorder leaves

3. If the parent overflows, then recurse on it by doing step 2 on the parent.

Why *copy/move*?

- we want to **COPY** leaf node data into the parent so that we don’t lose the data in the
leaf node. Remember that every key that is in the table that the index is built on must be in
the leaf nodes! Being in a inner node does not mean that key is actually still in the table.
- we can **MOVE** inner node data into parent nodes because the inner node does
not contain the actual data, they are just a reference of which way to search when traversing the tree.
