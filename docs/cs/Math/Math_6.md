# 6 Approximation and Randomized Algorithm
## Approximation

An optimization (minimization) problem is called $\epsilon$-approximable if
there exists a polynomial time algorithm that outputs a solution of
cost $C$, when the optimal cost is $C^*$, and $\frac{C}{C^*}\leq \epsilon$ or $\frac{C^*}C\leq \epsilon$

## Randomized Algorithm

- Monte Carlo: runs in polynomial time always and output is correct with high
probability
- Las Vegas: runs in expected polynomial time and output always correct
