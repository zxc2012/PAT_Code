# CS61C Lecture1 --RISCV Assembly

## RISC-V Architecture
- 1 word = 32 bits = 4 bytes

- registers: each 32 bits wide

    x0(holds the value zero)-x31

- Byte Ordering 

    Little Endian(x86, ARM)

## RISC-V Instructions

### Assembly Syntax

![20220310173933](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zxc2012/image/main/20220316201927.png)

1. no-op: an instruction that does nothing

```nasm
add x0,x0,x0 # Writes to x0 are always ignored...
```

2. immediates

- RISC-V immediates are "sign extended"(the upper bits are the same as the largest bit)

- for a 12b immediate, Bits 31:12 get the same value as Bit 11

3. Loading and Storing Bytes

    Transfer from Memory to Register: lw/lb
    
    Transfer from Register to Memory: sw/sb

- lb/sb utilize **the least significant byte of the register**
    - on lb, upper 24 bits are filled by sign-extension
    - on sb, upper 24 bits are ignored

    For e.g.,  s0 = 0x00000180

    ```nasm
    lb s1,1(s0) # s1 = 0x00000001
    lb s2,0(s0) # s2 = 0xFFFFFF80
    sb s2,2(s0) # *(s0) = 0x00800180
    ```
