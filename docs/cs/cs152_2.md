# CS152 Lecture2 --Complex Pipelining

## Basics

### Advanced Data Hazard

Out-of-order write hazards due to variable latencies of different functional units(FDIV,FMUL takes more than one cycle)

### In-order and Out-of-order

RAW(red) WAR(purple) WAW(green)

regrardless of WAR, look for what can be fetched next(dependency), if empty finish execute waiting instruction

### Table for Correct Issue

## In-order

Assuming: Suppose the instruction is not issued	by the Issue stage if a RAW	hazard exists or the required FU is busy,and that operands are registered by functional unit on issue

- NO WAR: Earlier instructions read	their operands at issue
    - no need to keep src1 and src2
- still WAW	hazard: e.g. Out-of-order completion
    - WP[reg#],a bit-vector to record the registers for which writes are pending(cleared after WB stage)
    - Busy[FU#],a bit-vector to	indicate FUâ€™s availability(FU=	Int,Add,Mult,Div)

Lookup:

- FU available?	*Busy[FU#]*
- RAW? *WP[src1] or WP[src2]*
- WAW? *WP[dest]*		

Example

Diagnol means pipeline

In-oder issue limitations

## Out-of-order

Decode adds	next instruction to	buffer	if	there is space and the instruction does not	cause a	WAR	or WAW hazard.	

Note: WAR possible again because issue is out-of-order(WAR not possible with in-order issue and registering of input operands at functional unit)	

Example

Number of Registers limit the number of instructions in	the	pipeline.

Solution: Renaming 5 f4->f4'(no WAW hazard)

### Renaming Issue

Decode does register renaming and adds instructions to the	 issue-stage instruction reorder buffer(ROB)

Renaming Table

tag deallocated-> broadcast and some src p1(present) set to 1

Reorder Buffer

ROB	managed	circularly
- exec bit is set when instruction begins execution
- When an instruction completes, its use bit is marked free(ptr2 incremented and tag deallocated)

Instruction is candidate for execution when
- use bit is set
- p1 and p2 are set 
- has not started execution(exec 0)
