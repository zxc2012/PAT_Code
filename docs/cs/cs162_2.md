# CS162 Lecture2 --Threads and Processes

## Process Management API
pthread: posix(portable operating system interface)
- join(pid) - suspends execution of the calling thread until the target *pid* terminates 
- exit – terminate a process
- fork – copy the current process
    - $>0$: Returned to parent or caller,return value is pid of new child
    - $=0$: Returned to the newly created child process
    - $<0$: error creating,running in original process
- exec – change the program being run by the current process
- wait –  pauses the parent until the child finishes,crashes, or is terminated
    ```c
    int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
        pid_t cpid,tcpid;
        cpid = fork();
        int status;
        pid_t mypid=getpid();
        if (cpid > 0) {               /* Parent Process */
            tcpid = wait(&status);
            printf("%d wait%d(%d)",mypid,tcpid,status);
        } else if (cpid == 0) {      /* Child Process */
            mypid = getpid();
            printf("[%d] child\n", mypid);
            char *myargs[3];
            myargs[0] = strdup("wc");   // program: "wc" (word count)
            myargs[1] = strdup("test.cpp"); // argument: file to count
            myargs[2] = NULL;           // marks end of array
            execvp(myargs[0], myargs);  // runs word count
            printf("this shouldn't print out.\n");
        }
    }
    ```
    output:

    > [8042] child

    > 8041 wait8042(256)
- kill – send a signal (interrupt-like notification) to another process
- signal – system call to send a notification to another process


Main thread creates (forks) collection of sub-threads passing them args to work on, and then *join*s with them, collecting results

## Race Condition

we need to make threads coordinate with each other to ensure **mutual exclusion** in accessing **critical sections** of code

### Lock

Locks provide two atomic operations

- Lock.acquire() – wait until lock is free; then mark it as busy
- Lock.release() – mark lock as free

Problem: SpinLock consumes cycles while waiting

```cpp
TSL(&address) { //test and set lock 
    result = M[address]; // return result from “address” and
    M[address] = 1; // set value at “address” to 1
    return result;
}
int value = 0; // Free
Acquire() {
    while (TSL(&value)) {}; // spin while busy
}
Release() {
    value = 0; // atomic store
}
```

Better Locks

```cpp
int guard = 0;
int value = FREE;
Acquire() {
    // Short busy-wait time
    while (TSL(guard));
    if (value == BUSY) {
        put thread on wait queue;
        run_new_thread() & guard = 0;
    } else {
        value = BUSY;
        guard = 0;
    }
}
Release() {
    // Short busy-wait time
    while (TSL(guard));
    if anyone on wait queue {
        take thread off wait queue
        Place on ready queue;
    } else {
        value = FREE;
    }
    guard = 0;
}
```

### semaphore

semaphore ['sɛməfɔr]`sema- :signal,phoro:carry,bring`

a semaphore has a non-negative integer value and supports the following two operations:
- P() or down(): atomic operation that waits for semaphore to become positive, then decrements it by 1
- V() or up(): an atomic operation that increments the semaphore by 1

P() stands for probe (to test) and V() stands for “verhogen” (to increment) in Dutch

### Producer-Consumer Problem

- Buffer Empty: The producer needs to first add a message to the shared buffer before the consumer can remove it
- Buffer Full: The producer needs to wait for the consumer to catch up

```cpp
semaphore mutex = 1, empty = N, full = 0;
Producer(item){
    empty.P();
    mutex.acquire();//1,2 注意顺序
    Enqueue(item);
    mutex.release();
    full.V(); //4,5顺序可颠倒
}
Consumer() {
    full.P();
    mutex.acquire();
    item = Dequeue();
    mutex.release();
    empty.V();
    return item;
}
```

### Monitors

Monitor
- Encapsulation
    - Local data variables are accessible only via the monitor’s entry methods
- Mutual exclusion
    - only one thread can be active in a monitor at any time
    - every method starts with lock and end with unlock

Condition Variables
- condition.wait(): a thread exits the monitor, waits for the *condition* variable to hold, and enters the monitor again when it does
- condition.signal(): signals (wakes up) a waiting thread on the *condition* variable, so that it can try to enter the monitor
- condition.broadcast(): signals (wakes up) all waiting threads on the *condition* variable, so that they can all try to enter the monitor

```cpp
mutex lock = unlocked;
Condition full,empty;
Producer(item){
    lock.acquire();
    if(buffer_full)full.wait();//wait when buffer is full
    Enqueue(item);
    empty.signal();
    lock.release();
}
Consumer() {
    lock.acquire();
    if(buffer_empty)empty.wait();//wait when buffer is empty
    item = Dequeue();
    full.signal();
    lock.release();
    return item;
}
```

The Producer is running in the monitor.It adds a message to an empty shared buffer,signals a waiting Consumer thread, waking it up. At this time, the Producer and Consumer cannot both run inside the monitor.

(1)Hoare Semantics

The signaled thread, B, enters the monitor immediately,then back to A(The signaling thread)

When a thread call signal():
- It releases the lock and the OS context-switches to the waiter, which acquires the
lock immediately
- When waiter releases lock, the OS switches back to signaler

(2)Mesa Semantics

The signaled thread is awakened,it will have to compete against all other threads for the monitor lock.

Problem previously: 

- When a thread is woken up by signal(), it is simply marked as eligible to run. 
- Another thread could be scheduled and "sneak in" make the condition it’s
waiting for no longer true.

Solution: if->while

```cpp
mutex lock = unlocked;
Condition full,empty;
Producer(item){
    lock.acquire();
    while(buffer_full)full.wait();//wait when buffer is full
    Enqueue(item);
    empty.signal();
    lock.release();
}
Consumer() {
    lock.acquire();
    while(buffer_empty)empty.wait();//wait when buffer is empty
    item = Dequeue();
    full.signal();
    lock.release();
    return item;
}
```

### The Dining Philosopher

Five Philosopher sit at a table

![20220520215436](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zxc2012/image/main/20220520215436.png)

```python
def philosopher(int i):
    while true:
        think()
        Pickup left fork
        Pickup right fork
        eat()
        Put down left fork
        Put down right fork
```

DeadLock

It may happen that all five philosophers take their left fork at the same time, and then try to take
their right fork, which is taken by a neighbouring philosopher

Solution

```python
semaphore forks[5]= {1,1,1,1,1}
def pickup_fork(int i):
    forks[i].down()
def putdown_fork(int i):
    forks[i].up()

def pickup_forks(int i):
    if i == 4:
        pickup_fork((i+1) modulo 5)
        pickup_fork(i)
    else:
        pickup_fork(i)
        pickup_fork((i+1) modulo 5)
def putdown_forks(int i):
    putdown_fork(i)
    putdown_fork((i+1) modulo 5)
```
