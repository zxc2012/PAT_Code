# CS162 Lecture3 --Scheduling

## Basic

Design Objectives
- Response Time: the time from when the job
arrives to the first time it is scheduled ($T_{firstrun} -
T_{arrival}$)
- Turnaround time: total time needed to complete a
job($T_{completion} - T_{arrival}$)
- Fairness: give each thread its fair share

Assumptions

- Each job runs for the same amount of time
- All jobs arrive at the same time
- Once started, each job runs to completion
- All jobs only use the CPU (no I/O)
- The run-time of each job is known

## FCFS

First-Come-First-Served

Relax assumption 1: jobs take the same amount of time

Consider $T_1,T_2,T_3$ sequence of scheduling

- Average response time for 1: 17
- Average response time for 2: 3

Problem: Short processes stuck behind long processes
