# CS162 Lecture3 --Scheduling

## Basic

Design Objectives
- Response Time: the time from when the job
arrives to the first time it is scheduled ($T_{firstrun} -
T_{arrival}$)
- Turnaround time: total time needed to complete a
job($T_{completion} - T_{arrival}$)
- Fairness: give each thread its fair share
