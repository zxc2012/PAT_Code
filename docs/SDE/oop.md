# 1 OOP
## Solid Principles

- Single-responsibility principle: Every class should have only one responsibility
- Openâ€“closed principle: Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification
- Liskov substitution: Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class(obey the rules)
- Interface segregation: Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do. Large interfaces should be devided into small ones
- Dependency inversion: Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions
